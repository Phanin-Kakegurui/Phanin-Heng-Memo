        <h1>The Future Education With Virtual Reality</h1>
        <div class="upload-date"><i>13rd of March 2021</i></div>

        <p>
            As one of the students during <sup><em>Covid-19</em></sup>, I am only limited to online classes to prevent
            further
            infection of the virus. More often than not, I and other students have faced a lot of
            <strong>difficulties</strong>
            because online education has failed to provide students valuable experiences such as collaborative and
            stimulative learning.
            The impact of never meeting the instructors and classmates can weaken the relationships among them.
            Furthermore, experiments in school could not be conducted wherefore it is more difficult for students to
            learn.
            As a consequence, it can compel students to give intense effort to focus rather than enjoying the lessons.
            It can also be worse than that when the students give up their online classes to do something else.
            However, these problems can still be alleviated by applying <strong><abbr
                    title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> to online education.
            </br>
            </br>
            According to <b>MARXENT</b>, <dfn><strong><abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> is the use of
                computer technology to create simulated
                environments.</dfn> <strong><abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> known as Virtual Reality
            can create
            virtual environments presented to our
            senses in
            such a way as if we are there. With the application of <strong><abbr
                    title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong>, online education can be more
            effective
            because students and teachers can now have better interaction that creates the willingness to participate.
            </br>
            </br>
            <strong><abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> can provide virtual classrooms for participants
            to collaborate more easily.
            Students can use integrated headsets and inbuilt cameras to create
            three-dimensional images that appear to be the same size as the image we see in real life.
            Subsequently, the devices can track students’ motions to
            adjust images in the display to reflect changes in their perspective.
            With this concept, students and teachers can now interact with each other from a distance as if they are
            together.
            According to <b>CLASSVR</b>, an experiment of virtual classrooms was conducted to find its efficiency of
            learning.
            In the cone of learning, students were able to participate in
            a discussion of about 70% and do the real thing about 90% compared to real life.
            </br>
            </br>
            Moreover, <strong><abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> can also improve experimentation in
            education before getting into the experience.
            It can trick the senses of students into believing that things they see and touch are real
            by distorting sound, sight, and speed of time. For instance, the <strong><abbr
                    title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> system can be set to
            help
            medical students overcome overwhelming emotions by performing a virtual operation before getting into the
            actual one.
            According to <b>Stanford Medicine</b>, the organs of the patient must be mapped out by capturing the images
            of the organs from different angles.
            All images will be formed into a three-dimensional space which will later be displayed in the headsets.
            With the same technique, medical students can use <strong><abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong>
            environments to practice their skills
            that can increase the rate of success in performing the surgery.
            </br>
            </br>
            Furthermore, <strong><abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> can help students understand
            subjects that are connected to a three-dimensional
            space.
            More often than not, some subjects require spatial ability to understand the concept.
            Teachers have always used visualization to assist their teaching so that students can truly see what things
            look like.
            Those visualizations are often used to describe a concept from a two-dimensional perspective
            when it is supposed to be from a <acronym title="three-dimensional">3D</acronym> one. However, <strong><abbr
                    title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> fits perfectly as a
            tool to help
            students understand better.
            According to <b>Hannes Kaufmann</b>, <strong><abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> was used
            as a benefit to help teachers with their visualization in Mathematics and Geometry.
            For instance, they have used <strong><abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr></strong> to create virtual
            objects in many different forms to analyze the
            equation in Algebra because it requires spatial ability to think which most students lack.
            </br>
            </br>
            In conclusion, this solution is effective and feasible for students to benefit from their learning
            from a distance that both prevents further infection of the virus and improves education.
            It could also keep students stimulated and focused while also giving them the pleasure and immersive
            experience in the pandemic.
            It can be implemented by the effort of government and international sponsorships to
            allow the community to keep up with the advancement technology.
